# Snake game!
This is my final homework project for my objective programming classes.

## External libraries used:
- lncurses

## Setup
First you have to install ncurses. After that, type ```make``` in bash in your repo directory. Next, after the program compiles itself you can type ```./winsys``` and play the game!

## Manual
You can press tab to switch to a different window. The are three windows, but only one is a game window, the rest was just a requirement. When in game window you can press ```p``` to toggle pause mode, ```h``` to toggle help mode, ```r``` to restart the game. When not in play mode you can play arrow keys to control the placement of game window. When in play mode arrow keys control direction of snake's movements. You cannot control the speed of its movement. At any moment you can press ```q``` to leave the program.
